## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.11+
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.11+ (to build the provider plugin)
- A Citrix ITM account with API access (see below)

## Building The Provider

To build the provider, make sure you have a working Go 1.11+ installation.

Clone the `terraform-provider-citrixitm` repo. Since there is a mod.go file and we're using Go 1.11+, this can be anywhere on your system, not necessarily under $GOPATH. Then change to the repo directory and build the provider by running `make build`.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:cedexis/terraform-provider-citrixitm.git
$ cd terraform-provider-citrixitm
$ make build
```

The `build` target does a couple of things. First it executes `scripts/gofmtcheck.sh`, which makes sure that all of the code files in the repository conform to Go formatting standards. Assuming the formatting check passes, it then executes `go install`, which builds the plugin binary and places it within `$GOPATH/bin`.

### OSX Setup With HomeBrew
This section assumes you already have [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) installed.

```bash
$ brew install golang
$ cd ~/Documents
$ git clone git@github.com:cedexis/terraform-provider-citrixitm.git
$ cd terraform-provider-citrixitm
$ make build
```
You should now be ready to start using the provider.

## Using The Provider

Using the provider requires a Citrix ITM account with access to the API. You can sign up by visiting the [Citrix ITM Portal](https://portal.cedexis.com).

To find out if your account has access to the API, navigate to `My Account > API > Oauth Configuration`. If you don't see these options then you'll need to send an email to [Citrix ITM Support](mailto:support@cedexis.com) and request API access.

### Installation

The Citrix ITM provider is a third party plugin and must be installed manually. This is simply a matter of taking the executable that you built in the previous section and copying it into the `$HOME/.terraform.d/plugins` directory.

Example:

```bash
$ mkdir -p $HOME/.terraform.d/plugins
$ cp $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-citrixitm $HOME/.terraform.d/plugins/
```

The Citrix ITM provider is now available for use in any Terraform configurations referencing it.

## Where To Go Next

Why not head over to the [Custom App From File](examples/dns/custom-app-from-file) example and give it a try?
